# Data Wrangling

---

# What is data wrangling?

![:space 5]

- **raw &rarr; processed**: the process of transforming data from one format to another.

- **converting the structure** to facilitate some analysis
  + **_altering the unit of analysis_**: going from individuals in a state in a given year to state-year by
  
  + changing from a **_"wide"_** (many columns, few rows) **_to a "long" structure_** (few colums, many rows)
  
  + **_summarizing data_** across specific subgroups 
 
---

## `tidyverse` approach 

![:space 5]

We are going to cover the basics of data manipulation and visualization in `R`. By focusing on a suite of packages known as the "[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org)". 

These packages were designed to ease the process of data manipulation and management so that it is more intuitive, efficient, and interpretable.

Specifically, the `tidyverse` is a housing package that holds the following packages:
- [readr](http://readr.tidyverse.org/) - for reading data in
- [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) - for "tidy" data structures
- [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) - for data manipulation
- [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) - for data visualization
- [tidyr](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) - for cleaning
- [purrr](http://purrr.tidyverse.org/) - functional programming toolkit

---

## `tidyverse` advantage 

![:space 15]

Most of everything we will do will require in data manipulation just **one** package

```{r,eval=F}
# Install tidyverse package
install.packages('tidyverse')

# Load the package
require(tidyverse)
```

class: newsection

# Manipulation

---

# Manipulation with `dplyr`

![:space 10]

The `dplyr` package (part of the `tidyverse`) offers an intuitive **verb based** approach to data management in `R`. 

![:space 5]

The goal of the `dplyr` logic is to provide an easy, intuitive naming convention for ubiquitous to data management tasks.

---

## `tibble()` data frames

![:space 10]

Differences between `tibbles` and `data.frames`

1. Tibbles have a refined print method that shows only the first 10 rows, and all the columns that fit on screen. This makes it much easier to work with large data.

2. More explicit errors: tibbles are strict. They throw lots of errors, meaning we catch mistakes early. 

---

## 6 main `dplyr` verbs

![:space 3]
- **`select()`**: Pick variables by their names.

- **`filter()`**: Pick observations by their values

- **`arrange()`**: Reorder the rows.

- **`mutate()`**: Create new variables with functions of existing variables.

- **`summarise()`**: Collapse many values down to a single summary.

- **`group_by()`**: changes the scope of each function from operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group. 
---

class:biglist


## How they work...

<br>
<br>

**All verbs work similarly:**

1. The first argument is a data frame.

2. The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame, using the variable names (without quotes).

3. The result is a new data frame.

---

To walk through the performance of the main `dplyr` verbs, we'll use an internal dataset called `presidential`.

```{r,eval=F}
?presidential # for information on the data
```
```{r}
dat <- presidential
head(dat)
```


---

# `select()`

.center[<img src="Figures/select.png">]

---

```{r}
select(dat,name,party)
```

---

Or variable ranges using `:`

The following will provide all variables in-between `name` and `end`.

```{r}
select(dat,name:end)
```

---

The **order** in which variables are selected will translate to the output. Thus, one can easily **reorder columns** with `select()`.
```{r}
select(dat,name,end,start)
```

---

We can also easily **rename** variables by simply providing a new name within the function.
```{r}
select(dat,president=name,
       startdate=start,
       enddate=end)
```

---

Lastly, `select()` offers us a convenient way to drop variables by using the same logic that we employed with putting a **negative sign** in front of a dimension. The only difference here is that we can do the same but with a variable name.

Here we **drop** the `start` date variable.
```{r}
select(dat,-start)
```

---

## `filter()`

![:space 3]

.center[<img src="Figures/filter.png">]

---

```{r}
filter(dat,party == "Republican")
```

---

## `arrange()`

![:space 3]

.center[<img src="Figures/arrange.png">]
---

```{r}
arrange(dat,party)
```

---

`arrange()` with the internal function `desc()` can change to a **descending** ordering.
```{r}
arrange(dat,desc(start))
```

---

## `mutate()`

![:space 3]

.center[<img src="Figures/mutate.png">]

---

```{r}
mutate(dat,
       # in office during cold war
       CW = start <= '1990-03-11')
```

---

`mutate()` also allows us to **_instantly_** use variables we just created.

```{r}
mutate(dat,
       CW = start <= '1990-03-11',
       CW = as.numeric(CW))
```

---

Like `mutate()`, `transmute()` provides a method for generating a new variable, but unlike the former, it **returns only the newly created variable**.

```{r}
transmute(dat,CW = start <= '1990-03-11')
```

---

## `summarize()`

```{r}
summarize(dat,
          days_in_office = mean(end-start),
          max = max(end-start),
          min = min(end-start))
```

---

There are a number of internal functions that can be used with `mutate()`, `transmute()`,
and `summarize()`.

- `n()` ::: counts the number of observations
- `n_distinct()` ::: counts the number of distinct entries

```{r}
summarize(dat,N=n(),N_party=n_distinct(party))
```

---

## `group_by()`

![:space 3]

.center[<img src="Figures/group_by.png">]

---

When used in conjunction with some of the other functions, `group_by()` becomes a powerful **clustering function**.
```{r}
# group by party
x <- group_by(dat,party)
summarize(x,min_in_office = min(end-start))
```


---

### Other functions in the tidyverse...

`tally()` or `count()` offers quick counts of a variable which can be quite useful when used alongside some of the other functions.

Here we are seeing how many observations we have _by group_.
```{r}
x <- group_by(dat,party)
count(x)
```


---

### Other functions in the tidyverse...

`recode()` allows you to quickly **recode a variable** (though conditional statements prove to be the most efficient way to do this)
```{r}
mutate(dat,party = recode(party,'Republican'=1,'Democratic'=0))
```

---

### And much more...

We've only covered a few functions here. Here are some more...
- `sample_n()` - Grab an N random sample of your data
- `sample_frac()` - Grab a random sample that is some fraction of your total data
- `top_n()` - get the top N number of entries from a data frame
- `slice()` - grab specific row ranges
- `glimpse()` - quickly preview the data

See [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf) to download a cheatsheet containing an entire list of the tidyverse `dplyr` verbs.

---

class:newsection

# Piping 

---

## Combining `dplyr` functions

When we need to do a series of manipulations, we can **perform each manipulation individually and save each entry as a new object** that we write over.
```{r}
x <- filter(presidential,party=='Republican')
x <- group_by(x,name)
x <- transmute(x,t_in_office = end-start)
x <- arrange(x,t_in_office)
x
```

---

Or we can **nest** functions _within_ each other.
```{r}
arrange(
  transmute(
    group_by(
      filter(presidential,party=='Republican'),name),
    t_in_office = end-start),
  t_in_office)
```

--

> The issue with **nesting functions** is that it is <font color = 'red'> difficult to (a) read and (b) detect a mistake!</font>

---

### Piping Functions

The **pipe** is a useful tool that allows us to **pass** output from one function to the next.

To pipe we write **`%>%`** _in-between_ each function.

.center[`data %>% function1() %>% function2()`]

We pass the output to specific locations in the proceeding function using the pointer `.`

.center[`data %>% function1(arg = .)`]

Piping offers is a clean way of manipulating data that is **intuitive and easy to read**.

---

Here we **pass** our `data` to `filter()` then to `group_by()` then to `transmute()` and then finally to `arrange()` which returns our output!

```{r}
presidential %>%
  filter(party=='Republican') %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  transmute(t_in_office = end-start) %>%
  arrange(t_in_office)
```

---

### Two things to keep in mind when piping...

1. Functions **_must_** be linked with `%>%`

2. When functions have **multiple arguments**, point to where the data should go with a period (`.`)
```{r,eval=F}
data %>% function(arg1= ., arg2=TRUE)
```


---

class:newsection

# Joining

---

## `_join` functions (dplyr)

![:space 5]

`dplyr` offers a range of joining/merging functions that are more intuitive to use. These functions provide a **SQL framework** that is easier to read and more efficient.
- `left_join()`
- `right_join()`
- `inner_join()`
- `full_join()`
- `anti_join()`

When joining data, you must have a **unique** identifier on the dimension you're matching on.

---

Consider the following two example datasets...
```{r,echo=F}
data_A = data.frame("country"=c("Nigeria","England","Botswana"),
                    "Var1"=c(4,3,6),stringsAsFactors = F)
data_B = data.frame("country"=c("Nigeria","United States","Botswana"),
                    "Var2"=c("Low","High","Medium"),stringsAsFactors = F)
```
```{r}
data_A
data_B
```

---

## `left_join()`

```

---

### `full_join()`

```{r}
full_join(data_A,data_B,by="country")
```

---

### `anti_join()`

.center[<img src="Figures/anti-join.gif", height=400px>]

---

### `anti_join()` 

.center[<img src="Figures/anti_join_left.png", height=100px>]

```{r}
anti_join(data_A,data_B,by="country")
```

---

## `bind_rows()`

<center> <img src="Figures/rbind.png"> </center>
```{r}
bind_rows(data_A,data_B)
```

---

## `bind_cols()`

<center> <img src="Figures/cbind.png"> </center>
```{r}
bind_cols(data_A,data_B)
```

---

## Disparate column names

Sometimes the naming conventions of two datasets don't perfectly align. When this happens, we can specify how data merges onto one another more explicitly using the `by=` argument.

Moreover, we can merge on **_more_ than one dimension** by specifying all relevant column names.

---

Once again, consider the following example data..
```{r,echo=F}
data_A = data.frame("country"=c("Nigeria","England","Botswana"),
                    'year'=c(1999,2001,2000),
                    "Var1"=c(4,3,6),stringsAsFactors = F)
data_B = data.frame("country_name"=c("Nigeria","United States","Botswana"),
                    'year'=c(1999,2004,2003),
                    "Var2"=c("Low","High","Medium"),stringsAsFactors = F)
```
```{r}
data_A
data_B
```

---

```{r}
full_join(data_A,data_B,
          by=c('country'='country_name',
               'year'))
```

# Reshaping

---

Often, we need to alter the structure of a `data.frame` from a **wide format**...
<br><br>

.center[
```{r,echo=F,fig.align="center"}
D <-
  expand.grid(
  country = c("Nigeria","Iran","Cambodia","Australia"),
  year = c("1992","1993","1994")
)
set.seed(123)
D$var <- round(rnorm(nrow(D),10,.5),2)

# Present as table
D %>% 
  spread(year,var) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable(.,align = 'c')
```
]

---

...into a **long format**

.center[
```{r,echo=F}
D %>% arrange(country) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable(.,align = 'c')
```
]


---

## `tidyr`

![:space 7]

`tidyr` is a tidyverse package built to help reshape data. The package contains an array of functions that are all useful cleaning a data construct. 

`tidyr` eases tasks such as:

- dropping missing values
- filling missing values
- separating a column into two variables or uniting two columns into one

We'll focus on two important functions designed to reshape data: **`gather()`** and **`spread()`**

---

  mutate(Y = rpois(n = n(),1.5))
```


## `gather()`: from wide-to-long

Two arguments:

- `key`: name of the variable that all the _variable **names**_ will be stored as. 
- `value`: name of the variable that all the _variable **values**_ will be stored as.

```


---

## `spread()`: from long-to-wide

.center[<img src ="Figures/spread.png">]

---

## `spread()`: from long-to-wide

Two arguments:

- `key`: name of the variable that will be spread out into columns. 
- `value`: variable that will be spread out along the key variable.
- `fill`: what values should fill missing cells? (`NA` by default)

```{r}
dat 
```

# Grammar of Graphics

---

.pull-left[<br><br><br><br><img src = "Figures/ggplot-hex.png">]

.pull-right[
`ggplot2` (a part of the `tidyverse` package) is a power graphics package that offers a flexible and intuitive graphics language capable of building sophisticated graphics.

<br><br>

`ggplot` has a **special syntax** that we'll have to get used to, _but_ once we understand the basics, we'll be able to produce some advanced and sophisticated graphics with ease!
]

---


.pull-left[<br><br><br><br><img src = "Figures/ggplot-hex.png">]

.pull-right[

`ggplot2` is based on a **grammar of graphics**. In essence, you can build every graph from the same components that follow the same intuitive naming conventions.

Every graph is composed of

1. a **dataset**

2. **coordinate system**

2. **mappings** &rarr; the variables we're aiming to visualize

3. **geom**etric expressions of how the data should be projected onto a space

]

---

### (1) data

Let's use the `diamonds` data, which is an example dataset provided by `ggplot` that contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds.

```{r}
glimpse(diamonds)
```

---

### (2) coordinate system

Use the `ggplot()` function to establish the coordinate system. 

```{r,fig.align="center",fig.height=4,dpi=600}
ggplot(data=diamonds)
```


---

### (3) mappings

What variables from the data do we want to map to the projected space?

- What variable makes up the y-axis?
- What variable makes up the x-axis?
- Are there any variables to group by? (More on this later)

--

<br><br>

Need to use a special function `aes()` (short for "aesthetics") to map variables from the data to the geometric space.

Whenever we want to plot a variable feature, we **_must_** wrap it in the `aes()` function.

---

### (3) mappings

What variables from the data do we want to map to the projected space?


```{r,fig.align="center",fig.height=4,dpi=600}
ggplot(data=diamonds,aes(x=price,y=carat))
```

---

### (4) geom &rarr; projection

How should your mappings be projected onto the coordinate space?

```{r,fig.align="center",fig.height=3.75,highlight=T,dpi=600}
ggplot(data=diamonds,aes(x=price,y=carat)) +
  geom_point() #<<
```

---

### (4) geom &rarr; projection

How should your mappings be projected onto the coordinate space?

.pull-left[

- `geom_` are aesthetic **layers** that are mapped onto the plot.

- We "add" layers and design preferences `+`.

- We can add as many layers as we want. Layers placed on top of one another in accordance with the order that they are specified.

- Plots can be assigned as objects and rendered later.

### Function Types in `ggplot2`

![:space 5]

| Type | Function Header | Description |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
|  Generate layers from data   |  `geom_` | Use a geom function to represent data points, use the geom’s aesthetic properties to represent variables. Each function returns a layer. |
|   Construct statistics layers   |  `stat_` | A stat builds new variables to plot (e.g., count, prop) |
|   Change mapping characteristics   |  `scale_` | Scales map data values to the visual values of an aesthetic. To change a mapping, add a new scale. |
|   Generate subplots   |  `facet_` | Facets divide a plot into subplots based on the values of one or more discrete variables.  |
|   Alter the plots theme   |  `theme_` | Change the aesthetics of the plot background and feature (e.g. axes, text, grid lines, etc.)  |

### Exporting Plots

Note that `ggplot` objects can assigned to an object. 

```{r,fig.align="center",fig.width=4,fig.height=2}
my_plot <- ggplot(cars,aes(speed,dist)) + geom_point()
my_plot
```

--

We can export (or build off of) these plot objects using `ggsave()`

```{r,eval=F}
ggsave(plot = my_plot,filename = "my_plot.pdf",
       device = "pdf",width=5,height = 5)
ggsave(plot = my_plot,filename = "my_plot.png",device = "png",dpi = 300)
```

> Supports "eps", "ps", "tex" (pictex), "pdf", "jpeg", "tiff", "png", "bmp", "svg" or "wmf" (windows only).
