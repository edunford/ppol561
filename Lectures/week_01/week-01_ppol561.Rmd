## Presentation Schedule

<center>

```{r,echo=F,message=F,tidy=T}
read_csv(here::here('Students/presentation_schedule.csv')) %>% 
  mutate(Week=c(3:9,11:14)) %>% 
  select(Group,Week,everything()) %>% 
  {.[is.na(.)]="";.} %>% 
  select(-contains('email')) %>% 
  kable(., "html", booktabs = T,align = c('c','c','c')) %>%

                row_label_position = 'c') 
```

## Main things to hit

![:space 5]

- What is the issue and why is it **interesting**?

- Why is it **hard to answer** the question?

- What is the **inferential** issue?

- How did this paper **meet the challenge**?

- What did they **find**?

---

![:space 7]

- **Be interesting**

  + Do **_![:text_color darkred](not)_** read notes
  
  + Don't pack too much in

  + Start strong with a “hook” and with interesting context
  

<br>

- **Know your audience**

  + They have advanced statistical knowledge

  + But they have not read the paper


---

![:space 7]

- **Be Concise**

  + You can't cover everything so don't try
  
  + Do not show huge tables of numbers &rarr; in fact, don't copy and paste any tables into your slide.
  
  + Generate compelling visuals.

  + If something is on a slide, explain it clearly.  (Otherwise cut it!)
  

- **Be Ready**

  + Practice out-loud at least twice (preferably to someone who hasn’t read the paper)
  
  + 10 minutes – not more, not less
  
  + Prepare for questions


---

## Critiques require context

An effective critique includes an explanation of how your point would change results

<br>

- **![:text_color darkred](Bad)**: 
> There are too many variables!

- **![:text_color darkgreen](Better)**: 
> Multicollinearity of variable $X_1$ and $X_2$ could increase the variance of $\beta_1$ and could explain its statistical insignificance


---

## Critiques require context

An effective critique includes an explanation of how your point would change results

<br>

- **![:text_color darkred](Bad)**:
> They didn’t include a variable for $Z$

- **![:text_color darkgreen](Better)**:
> $Z$ was omitted and we believe that excluding it matters as $Z$ is likely correlated with variable $X$, making us wonder if omitted variable bias has distorted the estimate of the effect of $X$ on $Y$.


---

## Critiques require context

An effective critique includes an explanation of how your point would change results


- **![:text_color darkred](Bad)**: 

> The study was only of California.

- **![:text_color darkgreen](Better, but still bad)**:
> The study was only of California, which is a very diverse state.

- **![:text_color darkgreen](Better)**:
> I’m concerned about the generalizability of the findings because I expect the coefficient on X to be different in a diverse state such as California due to …

---

## Critiques require context

![:space 7]
- Better to have 1 or 2 critique well explained than many poorly explained

- It's okay to piggy-back on some of the critiques addressed in subsequent publications; but you need to have some original content. 

- Be clear and explicit about why you think your proposed adjustment or issue pointed out might change the outcome of the analysis. 

- Be fair

  + Avoid "collect more data"-type critiques.

---

## Tips

- **_Start preparing early_**

- **_Coordinate_** & **_communicate_** with your partner  

- Hunt for an **_interesting paper_** (makes the exercise far more enjoyable)

  + Have a paper you already think is really interesting? Look at other papers in that journal. Georgetown subscribes to hundreds of academic journals.
  
  + Check out media/non-academic publications for features on academic work, such as the [Monkey Cage](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/). These articles will direct you to political science/public policy related work. 
  
- Keep in mind the paper must be a **_peer-reviewed_**, empirical article; ideally using one or more of the methods covered in this class

###Two Types of Inference

![:space 5]

**Descriptive Inference** &rarr; What are the facts?

+ Is the climate changing?
+ Is the United States politically polarized? 
+ Is global terrorism increasing?
+ Is Azerbaijan a democracy?

--

**Causal Inference** &rarr; Why does something occur?

- _Why_ is the climate changing?
- _Why_ is the United States politically polarized?
- _Why_ is (or is not) global terrorism increasing?
- _Why_ is (or is not) Azerbaijan a democracy?

---

### A Causal Research Question

Typically start with either

- (1) an **outcome** (dependent variable)

  - If what, then $Y$?
  - What _causes_ $Y$?
  - Associated with a search for causes, e.g. what causes climate change?

--

- (2) a **cause** (independent variable)

  - If $X$, then what? 
  - What happens if to $Y$ if $X$ goes up or down?
  - Associated with “experimentation”; e.g. What happens if we release greenhouse gases into the air?
  
  
---

### Which of these is a causal research question?

![:space 10]

- Will Democrats win the next U.S. presidential election?

- What factors increased the likelihood of Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 election?

- How has electoral performance for the Republican party changed over the last three decades?

- What was the result of the last U.S. presidential election?

- What role did the economy have on the last U.S. presidential election?

### Falsifiability

One of the tenets behind the scientific method is that any scientific hypothesis and resultant experimental design must be inherently _falsifiable_.

--

**Falsifiability** is the assertion that for any hypothesis to have credence, it must be inherently <u>disprovable</u> before it can become accepted as a scientific hypothesis or theory.

--

.center[**![:text_color darkred](Unfalsifiable)**]

.center[![:text_color darkred](Can _never_ shown to be false)]

.center[**![:text_color darkgreen](Falsifiable)**]

.center[![:text_color darkgreen](Can be shown to be false.)]

# Good research questions

### 1. Start from political problem or puzzle 

- Something important

- Not obvious

--

### 2. Builds on an existing research literature/Knowledge

- "Stand on the shoulders of giants"

- Don't reinvent the wheel

--

### 3. Falsifiable


---

## Generating Questions

### Puzzle-driven 

- Given what we know, we expect A but observe B. How interesting!

--

### Theory-driven 

- Deduction

--

### Data/Method-driven 

- Induction

--

### "Should"-driven

- normative

---

## Generating Theories

![:space 10]

![:center_img](Figures/theory_analysis.png)

---

## Generating Theories

### Approach 1: Reason _Inductively_

- Induction works by drawing generalities from specific observations

- Sometimes called “bottom-up” theorizing

--

<br>

### Approach 2: Reason _Deductively_

- Deduction begins from general, assumed principles/axioms to reach more specific observable realities

- e.g. Rational choice theory

---

## Generating Theories


What makes for a **_good theory_**:

- **Truth**: Maps to reality

- **Relevance**: Matters

- **Coherence**: Is clear

- **Falsifiability**: Can be disproven 

- **Precision**: Captures the concepts of interest

- **Generality**: Theories that can explain more are preferred over theories that can explain less

- **Parsimony**: Simple theories are preferred over complex theories

---

## Generating Hypotheses

- What would evidence consistent/inconsistent with the theory be? 

- Think about **_observable_ implications** derived from the theory

- Use causal ("if-then") logic

- **_Falsifiable_**

- Avoid **_Observational Equivalence_**
  
  - All hypotheses for two (or more) theories are identical
  
  - Different drivers yield the same results
  
  - Get around this by establishing clear **_scope conditions_**; reformulating question/theory/concept

---

### (_Social_) Scientific Method

![:space 2]

.center[

**Research question(s)** 

**Clarify the core concepts** 

**Develop (causal) theory (_with clear scope conditions_)**
