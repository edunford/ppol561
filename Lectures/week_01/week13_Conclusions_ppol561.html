###Two Types of Inference

![:space 5]

**Descriptive Inference** &amp;rarr; What are the facts?

+ Is the climate changing?
+ Is the United States politically polarized? 
+ Is global terrorism increasing?
+ Is Azerbaijan a democracy?

--

**Causal Inference** &amp;rarr; Why does something occur?

- _Why_ is the climate changing?
- _Why_ is the United States politically polarized?
- _Why_ is (or is not) global terrorism increasing?
- _Why_ is (or is not) Azerbaijan a democracy?

---

### A Causal Research Question

Typically start with either

- (1) an **outcome** (dependent variable)

  - If what, then `\(Y\)`?
  - What _causes_ `\(Y\)`?
  - Associated with a search for causes, e.g. what causes climate change?

--

- (2) a **cause** (independent variable)

  - If `\(X\)`, then what? 
  - What happens if `\(X\)`?
  - Associated with “Experimentation”; e.g. What happens if we release greenhouse gases into the air?
  
  
---

### Which of these is a causal research queston?

![:space 10]

- Will Democrats win the next U.S. presidential election?

- What factors increased the likelihood of Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 election?

- How has electoral performance for the Republican party changed over the last three decades?

- What was the result of the last U.S. presidential election?

- What role did the economy have on the last U.S. presidential election?

### Falsifiability

One of the tenets behind the scientific method is that any scientific hypothesis and resultant experimental design must be inherently _falsifiable_.

--

**Falsifiability** is the assertion that for any hypothesis to have credence, it must be inherently disprovable before it can become accepted as a scientific hypothesis or theory.

--

.center[**![:text_color darkred](Unfalsifiable)**]

.center[![:text_color darkred](Can _never_ shown to be false)]

.center[**![:text_color darkgreen](Falsifiable)**]

.center[![:text_color darkgreen](Can be shown to be false.)]

.center[**![:text_color darkred](Unfalsifiable)**]

&gt; ![:text_color darkgreen](_Increased levels_ of social welfare spending by the government _reduces_ the average level of poverty in the country.)

# Good research questions

### 1. Start from political problem or puzzle 

- Something important

- Not obvious

--

### 2. Builds on an existing research literature/Knowledge

- "Stand on the shoulders of giants"

- Don't reinvent the wheel

--

### 3. Falsifiable


---

## Generating Questions

### Puzzle-driven 

- Given what we know, we expect A but observe B. How interesting!

--

### Theory-driven 

- Deduction

--

### Data/Method-driven 

- Induction

--

### "Should"-driven

- normative

---

## Generating Theories

![:space 10]

![:center_img](Figures/theory_analysis.png)

---

## Generating Theories

### Approach 1: Reason _Inductively_

- Induction works by drawing generalities from specific observations

- Sometimes called “bottom-up” theorizing

--

&lt;br&gt;

### Approach 2: Reason _Deductively_

- Deduction begins from general, assumed principles/axioms to reach more specific observable realities

- e.g. Rational choice theory

---

## Generating Theories


What makes for a **_good theory_**:

- **Truth**: Maps to reality

- **Relevance**: Matters

- **Coherence**: Is clear

- **Falsifiability**: Can be disproven 

- **Precision**: Captures the concepts of interest

- **Generality**: Theories that can explain more are preferred over theories that can explain less

- **Parsimony**: Simple theories are preferred over complex theories

---

## Generating Hypotheses

- What would evidence consistent/inconsistent with the theory be? 

- Think about **_observable_ implications** derived from the theory

- Use causal ("if-then") logic

- **_Falsifiable_**

- Avoid **_Observational Equivalence_**
  
  - All hypotheses for two (or more) theories are identical
  
  - Different drivers yield the same results
  
  - Get around this by estabilishing clear scope conditions; reformulating question/theory/concept

---

### (_Social_) Scientific Method

**Research question(s)** 

**Clarify the core concepts** 

**Develop (causal) theory**

**Derive speciﬁc, testable hypotheses**

### Question 

The difference in means of the treated and control groups is not a good measure of the treatment effect when randomization fails to create balanced treatment and control groups.

--

&lt;br&gt;

### Answer

True

---

![:space 15]
### Question 

Pooled OLS models are biased when:

- (a) The fixed effects are correlated with the independent variable.
- (b) The fixed effects are correlated with the dependent variable.
- (c) The fixed effects model is used but in reality there are no fixed effects in the data.
- (d) We don't know the direction of the fixed effects.

--

&lt;br&gt;

### Answer

A

---

![:space 15]
### Question 

A key assumption for regression discontinuity is that the error term does not jump at the point of discontinuity.


--

&lt;br&gt;

### Answer

True

---

![:space 15]
### Question 

Describe how to asses if other variables act differently at the point of discontinuity, and explain the consequence of other variables jumping at the point of discontinuity.


--

&lt;br&gt;

### Answer

If other variables jump at the point of discontinuity, we may wonder if the people involved are somehow self-selecting (or being selected) based on some additional factors. If so, it could be that these other factors, not the treatment, are jumping at the discontinuity and causing a jump in `\(Y\)`.

---

### Question 

Suppose we wish to know if long prison sentences reduce the probability of recidivism. The basic model is `$$Repeat crime_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1Sentence length_i + \epsilon_i$$` where `\(Repeatcrime\)` is 1 for released prisoners who end up being sent back to jail after release. Which of the following is viable as an instrumental variable?

- (a) A variable indicating the severity of the initial crime.
- (b) A variable indicating that the person had been randomly assigned to a judge with a record of harsh sentencing.
- (c) A variable indicating that the person had been randomly assigned to an educational program while in prison.
- (d) A variable indicating whether the person was a high school dropout.


--

### Answer: B

---

![:space 15]
### Question 

Matching guarantees the identification of a causal relationship from observational data.

--

&lt;br&gt;

### Answer

False

---

![:space 15]
### Question 

A compliance problem can lead to endogeneity because non-compliance is generally not random.

--

&lt;br&gt;

### Answer

True


---

![:space 15]
### Question 

Explain why a fixed effects model is not necessary when fixed effects exist but are not correlated with the independent variable.

--

&lt;br&gt;

### Answer

In this case, the conditions for omitted variable bias are not satisfied, and omission of the fixed effects will therefore not cause bias.

---

![:space 15]
### Question 

If `\(Z\)` is a weak instrument, explain how its use will influence the variance of `\(\beta_j\)`.

--

&lt;br&gt;

### Answer

A weak instrument is one that does a poor job of explaining `\(X_1\)` when controlling for other factors. Its use in the model leads to a higher variance of `\(\beta_j\)` because will completely depend on the other independent variables (meaning the `\(R^2\)` of a regression predicting `\(X_1\)` as a function of the non-instrumental variables will be high).


---

![:space 15]
### Question 

We employ binned graphs in order to:

- (a) Help us ignore the functional form of the model and allow us to use a liner model regardless of the true relationship.
- (b) Help us determine the functional form of the model.
- (c) Increase the statistical power of the model.
- (d) Deal with endogeneity.

--

&lt;br&gt;

### Answer

B


---

![:space 15]
### Question 

Which of the following is false?

- (a) Fitted values from probit models and logit models are very similar when they are based on the same data.
- (b) The coefficients in probit models and logit models are very similar when they are based on the same data.
- (c) Probit models are slightly more accurate than logit models.
- (d) Logit models make sense when using logged variables.

--

&lt;br&gt;

### Answer

B


---

![:space 15]
### Question 

When matching, every treated observation must be precisely matched with a complementary control observation?

--

&lt;br&gt;

### Answer

False

---

![:space 15]
### Question 

One way to check for balance between the treatment and control groups is to look for a statistically significant coefficient on the treatment dummy variable in a model in which variable `\(X_1\)` is the dependent variable.

--

&lt;br&gt;

### Answer

True

---
